Quantum Computing Research on creating optimal reversible truth tables for reversible logic circuit synthesis

## Abstract

As conventional computers continue to get faster and more efficient, they begin to approach their hardware limitations. The upbringing of Quantum Computing gives rise to advances in technology that will solve problems that computers today are not able to solve. One of Quantum Computing’s advantages over Digital Computing is that all logic gates are reversible. This distinct characteristic has led to research in Reversibility Synthesis in both Digital Computer Design and Quantum Computer Design. <br><br>
In this paper, I will be exploring a method, RTT, of creating Reversible truth tables from conventional truth tables in a way that most efficiently uses garbage bits and antica bits. While today we are able to compute small reversible truth tables for some conventional truth tables, this method will make it possible to take larger functions and generate a reversible truth table to reduce energy dissipation in today’s computers, as well as to make it easier to generate Reversible Quantum gates.
